    - Changing the same index to the same number multiple times â†’ no change.

    - Changing an index multiple times to different numbers, then back.

    - find for numbers that have had their indexes changed.
    
    Approach
    The approach involves using two primary data structures:

    Index Mapping: A dictionary to keep track of the current number at each index.

    Number Heaps: A dictionary where each key is a number and the value is a min-heap of indices. This allows efficient retrieval of the smallest index for any given number.

    Operations:

    Change Operation: When inserting or replacing a number at an index, update the index mapping and push the index into the corresponding number's heap. If the index was previously associated with another number, the old number's heap is not modified directly but will be cleaned up lazily during subsequent find operations.

    Find Operation: For a given number, check the corresponding heap. Remove invalid indices (those that no longer hold the number) from the heap until a valid index is found or the heap is empty.
